# LeetCode Analytics App Modularization Plan

## Background and Motivation
The current codebase has most of its logic in a single large page.tsx file (1017 lines). This makes the code harder to maintain, test, and understand. We need to break it down into smaller, focused modules following React and TypeScript best practices.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Large monolithic component with multiple responsibilities
2. Mixed concerns (UI, data processing, state management)
3. Complex filtering and sorting logic
4. Multiple feature areas (problems, companies, analytics)
5. Shared utilities and types scattered throughout

## High-level Task Breakdown

### 1. Create Core Type Definitions
- [ ] Create `types/` directory
- [ ] Move all TypeScript interfaces and types to appropriate files
- Success Criteria: All types are centralized and properly exported

### 2. Extract State Management
- [ ] Create `hooks/` directory
- [ ] Create custom hooks for:
  - Data fetching and processing
  - Filtering logic
  - Sorting logic
  - Range management
- Success Criteria: All state management logic is moved to custom hooks

### 3. Create Feature Components
- [ ] Create feature directories under `components/`:
  - problems/
  - companies/
  - analytics/
  - filters/
- Success Criteria: Each feature area has its own directory with related components

### 4. Extract Utility Functions
- [ ] Create `utils/` directory
- [ ] Move helper functions to appropriate utility files
- Success Criteria: All utility functions are properly categorized and exported

### 5. Refactor Main Page Component
- [ ] Update page.tsx to use new modular components
- [ ] Clean up imports
- [ ] Remove unused code
- Success Criteria: page.tsx is reduced to core layout and composition logic

## Project Status Board
- [x] Task 1: Create type definitions
  - Created types/analytics.ts with core type definitions
  - Created types/props.ts with component prop interfaces
- [x] Task 2: Extract state management hooks
  - Created hooks/useAnalyticsData.ts for data fetching
  - Created hooks/useFilters.ts for filtering logic
  - Created hooks/useSorting.ts for sorting logic
  - Created hooks/useRangeFilter.ts for range management
- [x] Task 3: Create feature components
  - Created components/problems/ProblemsTable.tsx
  - Created components/companies/CompanyAnalytics.tsx
  - Created components/filters/FiltersPanel.tsx
  - Created components/filters/RangeFilter.tsx
- [x] Task 4: Extract utility functions
  - Created lib/csv-processor.ts for data processing
  - Created lib/github-api.ts for GitHub integration
  - Created lib/logger.ts for logging
  - Created lib/error-handler.ts for error handling
  - Created components/ui/chart.tsx for chart configuration
- [x] Task 5: Refactor main page
  - Refactored page.tsx to use modularized components
  - Integrated state management hooks
  - Cleaned up imports and removed unused code
  - Simplified component structure

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Completed Task 5: Refactored main page
- Refactored page.tsx to use modularized components
- Integrated state management hooks for data, filters, and sorting
- Simplified component structure and layout
- Removed unused code and imports

Current Issues:
1. StatusIndicator component has correct types but needs LoadingSpinner component
2. FiltersPanel has duplicate interface definition (one in props.ts and one in component)
3. CompanyAnalytics component has correct types but needs LoadingSpinner component

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Next steps to complete the modularization:

1. Create missing UI components:
   - [ ] Create LoadingSpinner component
   - [ ] Move FilterState interface to types/props.ts
   - [ ] Remove duplicate interface from FiltersPanel

2. Add missing features:
   - [ ] Add Analytics tab with charts and statistics
   - [ ] Add Resources tab with helpful links and documentation

3. Testing and validation:
   - [ ] Test all components in isolation
   - [ ] Test the application end-to-end
   - [ ] Verify all type errors are resolved

Would you like me to proceed with creating the missing UI components first?

## Lessons
- Always define and use proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Keep component responsibilities clear and focused
- Use custom hooks for complex state management
- Document component interfaces and expected behavior
- Test components in isolation before integration
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use custom hooks for complex state management
- Group related functionality in feature directories
- Maintain clear type definitions

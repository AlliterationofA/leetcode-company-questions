# Background and Motivation
The repository has accumulated code, configuration, and dependencies that may no longer be referenced anywhere in the application. Cleaning the project improves maintainability, reduces build size and attack surface, and speeds up developer workflows.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Accurate Detection**: Identifying genuinely unused files, exports, and packages without false-positives that could break runtime behavior.
2. **Tool Choice & Configuration**: Selecting static-analysis tools (e.g. `ts-prune`, `depcheck`) and configuring TypeScript project references correctly so results are reliable.
3. **Verification**: Ensuring removal does not break compile, test, or runtime. Requires regression test suite and manual smoke tests.
4. **Incremental Cleanup**: Large deletions should be performed in small verifiable commits.

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. âœ… Baseline Validation: Install dependencies and verify build
2. âœ… Inventory Codebase: Document structure and entry points
3. âœ… Detect Unused Exports: Run ts-prune to find unused TypeScript exports
4. âœ… Analyze Dependencies: Run depcheck to find unused packages
5. âœ… Classify Changes: Determine what's safe to delete vs keep
6. âœ… Remove Unused Code: Delete unused files and dependencies
7. âœ… Verify and Document Changes
8. ðŸ”„ Final Review and Cleanup

# Project Status Board
## Completed Changes
- âœ… Removed unused `components/ui/header.tsx`
- âœ… Removed duplicate `components/ui/use-mobile.tsx` (main version in hooks/)
- âœ… Removed unused Node.js built-in modules (`fs`, `path`) from package.json
- âœ… Verified build passes after changes

## Final Review Findings
1. Remaining "Unused" Dependencies (Must Keep):
   - `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod`: Used for form validation (dynamically imported)
   - `autoprefixer`, `postcss`: Required by Tailwind CSS
   - `date-fns`: Used for date formatting (dynamically imported)
   - `typescript`: Required for TypeScript compilation
   - `depcheck`, `ts-prune`: Development tools for code analysis

2. Remaining "Unused" Exports (Must Keep):
   - Default exports in `tailwind.config.ts` and `app/loading.tsx`: Required by Next.js conventions
   - `Toaster` in `components/ui/toaster.tsx`: Used in toast notification system
   - Various UI component exports: Used through dynamic imports or required by the component library

3. Build Health:
   - Build Size: Optimized (101 kB shared, 287 kB main route)
   - No TypeScript errors
   - No runtime errors
   - All routes functional

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Final review complete
- All identified unused code has been safely removed
- Remaining "unused" items are false positives that are actually required
- Project is in a clean, optimized state

# Lessons
1. Node.js built-in modules (`fs`, `path`) were listed as dependencies but aren't needed in browser-side Next.js code
2. Duplicate hooks should be consolidated in a single location (hooks directory)
3. Components not imported anywhere can be safely removed after thorough verification
4. Static analysis tools may report false positives for:
   - Dynamically imported dependencies
   - Framework-required files
   - Development tools
5. Always verify build and runtime behavior after removing code

The cleanup process is now complete. Would you like to:
1. Commit the changes
2. Run additional verification
